# London Bikes Dashboard

## Objective
To analyze and visualize bike-sharing usage patterns in London using key metrics such as rental volume, weather conditions, seasonal variation, and user behavior. This dashboard aims to support city planners, environmental researchers, and transportation analysts in making data-driven decisions regarding public bike infrastructure and usage trends.

## Challenges
Working with the London bike-sharing dataset involved several data preparation and analysis challenges:

- Time-based formatting inconsistencies and conversions (e.g., hourly timestamps).

- Missing or anomalous values in weather and humidity data.

- Normalizing temperature and windspeed values for meaningful comparisons.

- Identifying trends despite cyclical patterns and external variables like holidays or weather events.

## Solution
Developed an interactive dashboard by preprocessing the dataset using Python (Pandas), performing exploratory analysis, and visualizing insights with Tableau. The dashboard enables users to:

- View total rentals by time, day, and season

- Analyze correlations between weather conditions and rental behavior

- Compare weekday vs weekend usage patterns

- Identify peak rental hours and environmental factors affecting ridership

- This dashboard empowers coaches, analysts, journalists, and Olympic committees to gain fast, intuitive insights from a historically rich and complex dataset.
